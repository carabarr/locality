C. Implementation

    We believe that our implementation for all parts are correct.
    We have tested our implementation for UArrab2b and pnmtrans and believe
    that all functions behave properly with the test files given and test
    files we have created on our own. All of the pnmtranns commands work
    properly. Some of our tests come from /comp/40/bin/images/. We did not
    implement ANY extra credit options.

D. Documentation/architecture

    For UArray2b:

    For UArray2b, we closely followed the spec's sample architecture.
    Our UArray2b is represented by a UArray2_T, where each element contains
    one block. Each block is represented by ONE UArray_T.

    For pnmtrans:

    We used the driver code directly provided on page 12 and 13 of the spec.
    We found that using this driver code was relatively easy, and we added
    the lines of code that decide if a file has been directly piped in or read
    from standard input. The commands that are typed in by the user are
    executed by a series of if/else statements, each which call
